# VisualisationAndSensing

In Mordern days, along with evolution of technologies, our planet starting to look different from when it used to be. Through satellite imagery, more and more areas has changed drastically over time. I want to study the relationship between data and colors, how it is sort on different data visualisation method.

# Research Journey


During my research journey, I looked into Ladybug maps and tools. Studying data visualisation by using Ladybug resources and Rhino3d to make wind rose diagrams.

A wind rose diagram, also known as a wind rose plot or polar plot, is a graphical tool used to visualize the wind speed and wind direction patterns at a specific location over a given time period. It provides a concise summary of the prevailing wind directions and their corresponding frequencies or wind speeds. This diagram represented the wind speed of London during summer and winter time. According to this visualisation method, the wind speed is color coded red represent the fastest and blue represent the slowest.

From this diagram, we can see by using color code, temperature data are clearly displayed from the highest to lowest. During April to October, where summer period is, red is most concentrated in this area.

# Visualisation of mean temperature in London

## Project Overview

For my project, I wanted to apply color code of data visualisation. I Found a publicly avaliable dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data?resource=download
###

This data set contains the change of temperature/cloud_cover/pressure/snow_depth etc. every day through 1979 to 2020.

### Plot Data Using Matlab

This visualisation shows, as time goes along the mean temperature of London increased. This could be due to Urban heat island , the UHI can cause London to be up to 10'C warmer than neighbouring rural areas. This is because the sun's rays are absorbed by hard surfaces rather than by vegetation such as trees, plants and grass. Radiation from our hard surfaces is released into the air as heat. So I wanted to make my project in to a 3D object looking like an island, where data can be displayed from all dimensions.

Because this linear diagram has a lot of overlaps, I marked the most overlap bits with higher saturated colors. I then traced the diagram on to a 3D model. I then exband the linear diagram from y-axis, the peak shows the mean temperature of london is mostly concentrated between 0-10 celsius.

# Other Small Attempt
## Touch Designer

I wanted to make a reactive live data cloud with touch designer, so I imported my csv file and connect it to Chop to SOP operator to convert data into 3D geometry.
However this did not worked as i wanted it to be

## P5js

Another small project I attempted is a p5js sketch with the use of api key from https://openweathermap.org/api
